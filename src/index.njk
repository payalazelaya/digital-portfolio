      <h1 class="section-title">Welcome to my Portfolio!</h1>
      <p>Here, I've uploaded the work I'm most proud of in my skills, whether that would
      be web design, visual design, traditional design, or other work I've done. There are plenty of projects I've
      uploaded so I hope you're able to enjoy them!</p>
      <p>Below are some of my favorite work that I'm immensely fond of, or you can go to the blog page to see my most recent posts.</p>

      <h1 class="section-title">About Me!</h1>
      <p>I am an aspiring web developer hoping to contribute to a community where I can, figuratively, glow as an effective group member 
      and shine for what kinds of ideas and creativity I can provide to them. </p>
      <p>Web development has impacted my mindset in how I view websites that my thoughts now consist of,
      "Isn't this a visual error that obscures this paragraph here?", "This navigation bar looks like it needs fixing if it's this annoying having to
      hover over it so the options can go away.", or "There's too much white space between these elements but is it acceptable because of the website layout?</p>
      <p>I'm also a Latina first-generation student to attend higher education in my family for those who want to know a little bit of my background, 
      along with sharing how I'm a fan of art, plushies, cats, desserts, and music.</p>
