### D﻿escription of Website - Digital Memory Book

[﻿Link to Digital Memory Book](https://girlswhocode2021.wordpress.com/)

T﻿his was a side project that I created for Girls Who Code, a club I participated in when I was in high school, where I had the thought of making a website that kept track of the memorable moments that happened in our meetings. Thus, the theme of a Digital Memory Book came to my mind but in the form of a website of course. This was my first experience using WordPress and how I learned to navigate with the features of WordPress to result with what's the final draft of the website.
