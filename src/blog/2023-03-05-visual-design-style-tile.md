### Description of Style Tile - Color Combinations Galore

This is a style tile done in Figma for Web Development II, where it was the starting point of what theme I wanted to do for the final project, which was customizing the Style Stage challenge created by Stephanie Eckles, a web developer. My theme was essentially stars, but the name that I chose for the theme ended up being Shimmering Stars because of the color scheme that I went with, where the pale yellow that I used resembles the shine of stars when they shimmer across the night sky. Things that the style tile features are different examples of typography, color scheme and adjectives to describe each color, button layouts, and extra inclusions I thought about adding.
