### Description of Pattern - Eye See You

This is a repeated pattern design that I created for the front and back cover of a booklet that was for my final project in 2D Design, where the theme of the final project was "Mapping Out The Body". The body part that I chose to do for the final project was the eye, thus using the stencils that I had made in Part 1 of the 3-part final project, I was able to create one portion of the pattern in this part, which was Part 2 of the project. I decided to go with a horror-like design for the pattern when it came to thinking deeply about how the eye can be depicted in a scary manner. The result of this thinking ended up being the repeated pattern that was edited in Photoshop to get each tile to repeat one after the other and create a unique design for my booklet.
