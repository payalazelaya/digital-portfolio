### Description of Font Sheet - Glimpse Into Avant-Garde

This font sheet was my beginning introduction to how font sheets are set up in including typography, color schemes, explanations, logos, and much more for it to be included in design documentation for a particular project, where in this case this was used for my Glimpse Into Avant-Garde design documentation in Interactive Multimedia. The font sheet was simple in this case to include the basic features to get a sense of why certain fonts were chosen, or why the color scheme is suitable for the theme of the project.
