These wireframes are a part of the 3-step process for the Midterm project that occurred in my Interface Design & Human Computer Interaction class, where the wireframes were the third part of it to provide visual context of an app me and a partner designed for a particular topic and users. Our topic was to focus on museums and how a large-scale museum can offer transportation through the use of scanning a QR code through the museum's app for its visitors if they want to visit other buildings that are remotely too far to walk, similar to how this would suit the Smithsonian Museums in Washington D.C. for example.
