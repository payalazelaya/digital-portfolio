### D﻿escription of Painting - "The Grand Opening" 

T﻿his painting depicts a canyon landscape that's painted in desaturated browns, showing how it's represented through the natural colors of Earth, while the celebratory items like the balloons and the grand opening sign are painted in saturated bright colors, or in other words artificial colors to depict the joy of a landscape being open for the public, figuratively of course. As one of the weekly assignments that was assigned in my Color Theory class, this painting was a favorite of mine to have done when playing around with the theme that I wanted to convey and what I would've liked to see being contrasted based on the topic of natural vs artificial colors, plus what concept fitted the most when it came to desaturated browns.
