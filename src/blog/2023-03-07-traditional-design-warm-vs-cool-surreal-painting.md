### Description of Painting - The Dog's View of a Shape-Induced World

This is a painting that I did in my Color Theory course where one of the weekly assignments was a painting focusing on Warm vs Colors and Surrealism at the same time. These topics were also topics that were gone over in class to get a better understanding of how to have depicted them in our paintings that we did individually. What I chose to do the painting on was of a dog sitting in front of a window, gazing outside to a world of 3-D floating shapes that are seen in cool colors, compared to the dog and the interior where it's warm colors instead. This painting also practiced the concept of interior vs exterior as a big factor that shows this is the dog sitting on top of the window sill, looking outside from the interior window it's in.
