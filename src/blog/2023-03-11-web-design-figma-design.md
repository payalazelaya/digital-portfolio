### D﻿escription of Design - Figma Design

T﻿his was one of the smaller assignments done in Web Development II to practice how to use Figma for future assignments and how to use a color scheme to coordinate each color with a specific element in a layout, just like the one that's shown in the image. Using a predominantly blue color scheme, I was able to coordinate each color to an element that best suited the color such as for example, the desaturated blue being suitable for the background and the bright light blue for the hover underline in the navigation bar.
