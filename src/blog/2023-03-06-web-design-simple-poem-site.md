### Description of Website - Simple Poem Website

[Link to Poem Website](https://bedinsummer.netlify.app/)

This is an image of the layout for a poem website that I made at the beginning portion of my Web Development II class to practice HTML and CSS again. This sample poem website shows how to center text to the middle and include a separation between stanzas to emphasize how the text presented is of a poem, and an image to give a sense of what the poem is truly about.
