### Description of Website - Simple Blog Website

[Link to Personal Blog Website](https://payalazelaya.netlify.app/)

The screenshot above shows the layout of the homepage of my personal blog website which I have customized to my liking and where it features blogs about topics related to web development too. Customizing this website has made me get practice and experience in being able to use Netlify CMS to add blogs to the website and how Github and Netlify's connection can go hand in hand with one another. Working within VS Code also assisted me in being able to customize the CSS and change the color scheme of the website, in addition to the font too.
