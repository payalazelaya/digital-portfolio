### D﻿escription of Website - Counting Stars

[L﻿ink to SVG Animation Website](https://counting-stars-payalazelaya.netlify.app/)

T﻿his was another assignment to practice with the animation property through CSS, but in this case, it's with the help of making SVG's come to life and making them move at a certain speed. The SVGs that I chose for this assignment were of 2 friends stargazing and looking at the night sky filled with stars, where the tiny stars move in the sky and the trees at ground level move back and forth to mimic the wind blowing them around.
