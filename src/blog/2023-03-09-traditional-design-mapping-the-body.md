### Description of Project - Eye See You

This is part 3 of the final project that was assigned in my 2D Design class, where in this part, it covered how to create a booklet depicting the "map of a body part" through 3 intertwined 2-page layouts that accurately portray the theme of a body part. In each section of the 2-page layout, I wanted to illustrate different themes that came to my mind when thinking about the meaning behind the eye, such as the ooze of blood, the eerie interpretation of the eye anatomy, and the creepiness of blood-shot stares of eyeballs.
