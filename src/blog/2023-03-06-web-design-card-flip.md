### Description of Project - Card Flip: Music Theme

[Link to Animated Card Flip](https://csscardflip-payalazelaya.netlify.app/)

One of the assignments done in Web Development II was creating an animated card flip when it was the week the topic of animations, transitions, and translations were gone over. Essentially, the theme was anything that we would want to do the card on, thus I went with a music theme but made it about my most listened-to music genre at the moment, K-Pop. I chose my favorite member from one of my most listened-to groups, JUN of SEVENTEEN, to be who I did my animated card about and included on the back some of his personal information like a normal card would. This assignment was really unique in playing around with how to do animations through transitions and translations within CSS, making sure to follow how the properties worked so the animation could've worked when testing it out in a Live Server first.

Down below is the back side of the card when the mouse is hovered over so it could flip:
