![A layout of a UI element that features a cat emoji, subtitle headings, main headings, body text and buttons](/assets/blog/cat-ui-design.png "UI Beginner's Guide to Applying Color")

F﻿eatured above is a sample UI element and how it's laid out to include an image, subtitle heading, main heading, body text, and buttons to show what kind of theme it is. In this case, the theme of this element is demonstrating a cat that's up for adoption, a brief description of what kind of personality the cat has, and whether to add the cat's adoption to the cart for later usage or to adopt the cat at the moment through the "buy now" button.
