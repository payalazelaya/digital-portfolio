This is the second and final project done in my Interactive Multimedia class where in this project, it was the purpose of utilizing all 5 building blocks of multimedia to create an application that would demonstrate how the 5 building blocks go hand in hand. Similarly to Multimedia and Me, I decided to do another PowerPoint presentation that in this case, covered one art period in art history called Art Nouveau and included famous paintings from the art period, a timeline, audio that would've been fitting for the art period, and a video that explained the significance of the Art Nouveau time period.
