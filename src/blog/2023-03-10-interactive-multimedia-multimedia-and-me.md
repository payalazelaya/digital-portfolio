### Description of PowerPoint - Multimedia and Me

[Link to Multimedia and Me](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AlZJQZKp3m1QeyMdR6o5xhed9QI?e=vuiLDv)

This is one of two projects done in my Interactive Multimedia class where for this project, our assignment was to create a presentation that would teach the 5 building blocks of multimedia to a targeted audience that we chose to focus on, which in my case this presentation would be heavily suited for middle schoolers or beginning high schoolers. The presentation is broken down into sections that elaborate about each of the 5 building blocks of multimedia, along with examples that go along with each building block.
