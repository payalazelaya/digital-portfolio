Gï»¿etting practice with drafting out sketches of business cards was where I made myself get creative with different versions of cards that I can come up with for potential use of them. I was able to draft out 3 versions of business cards using ideas that came to my mind when thinking about what designs would be visually appealing to a client who would like to work with me. Down below is the back side of the 1st version, along with the front & back sides of the 2nd and 3rd versions.
